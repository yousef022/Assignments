      //Solution is 15 lines of code.  The instructions make it look like a longer assingment than it really it is.

      //Event handler setup
      //1. Create an event handler on the window object for the load event 
      window.addEventListener("load", function(e){
          console.log("The page has been loaded");
      });

      //2. Create an event handler on the window object for the mousemove event  
        window.addEventListener("mousemove",function(e){
          x = e.offsetX;
          y = e.offsetY;
          var newX = e.clientX + 100;
          var newY = e.clientY + 100;

          var spaceship = document.getElementById("spaceship1");

          spaceship.style.left = newX + "px";
          spaceship.style.top = newY + "px";

          spaceship.style.left = parseInt(spaceship.style.left) + 20 + 'px';
          spaceship.style.top = parseInt(spaceship.style.top) + 20 + 'px';

          newCoorX = spaceship.style.left + x;
          newCoorY = spaceship.style.top + y;

          //Seems to cause interference
          //spaceship.style.left = Math.random()*200 + 100 + 'px';
          //spaceship.style.top = Math.random()*200 + 100 + 'px';             




        });
        //3. Inside of the callback function of this event handler, create offset distances for X and Y from the mouse
    
    //Move the spaceship towards the mouse 
    //4. Get the image element & store it in a variable 
    //5. move the image by setting the coordinates of left & top refer to slide .  Ex. node.style.left = your coordinates calculation here.  
    //Note node is the variable name you stored your image element in.
    //Note the left & top properties track the x & y coordinates respectively & must be set seperately.
    
    //Coordinates calculation for left & top properties
    //6. Use the JS built-in function parseInt() to cast your calculation from a float to an int. Refer to https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_parseint.asp 
    //7. Get the current x & y coordinates & add the offset from step 3.
    //8. Use the JS built-in function Math.random() to add a random number to increment the movement of the image following the mouse. 
    // Ex. + (Math.random()*200 + 100))
    //Refer to https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_random.asp 
    //9. Concatenate the pixel unit to your calculation. Ex. + 'px';
      
  
  //Move the alien away from the cursor when the cursor is moved close to the alien image.
  //10. Get the image element & store it in a variable 

  //11. Get browser's current width & height to set a horizontal limit for the alien image & store in variables.


    //12. Attach an event handler to the alien image for the mouseover event
    //13. Use the target property of the event object to change the coordinates. Ex. event.target.style.left = your coordinates calculation (again refer to steps 8 & 9)
    //14. Your coordinates calculation requires the variables created in step 11.
